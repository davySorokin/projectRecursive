# projectRecursive

Machine learning challenge featuring SGD, MLPs, and scalable high-resolution computations.

A comprehensive machine learning project completed as part of a take-home challenge for a Machine Learning Engineer role at Recursive. This repository showcases implementations of key ML concepts, including:

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  
  Manual implementation for logistic regression with decision boundary visualisation.

- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):**  
  Designed and trained to interpolate missing data from noisy and incomplete datasets, including extensions to handle additional features.

- **High-Resolution Computations:**  
  Efficiently computed minimum distances on extremely large grids (up to 65,536 x 65,536) using memory-efficient tiling strategies.

This project focuses on balancing computational efficiency, resource constraints, and robust validation through visualisations. It reflects practical problem-solving and adaptability in machine learning workflows.
